Joint work with Brooke Spring 2023
January 20th: Discuss the multiplex community detection article, introduce the network datasets and go over the code
Run findingk.m with the data (cell array) and find k, kc, kpr. If k<3 for any of the layers, discard the results. Similarly, if k> 20 for any of the layers, discard 
the results. If this is the case, fix k=6 for each layer, kc=3, kpl=3. Run MX-ONMTF with modularity density for real networks.
January 27th (need to change meeting time): initially run the algorithm with different K rather than learning it from data, go over the initial run of the algorithm on 20 ERN networks and discuss potential problems
Feb 3rd (need to change meeting time): change delta in EigenGap to see if we get larger K, start with 0.5. For now, set kc=K (assume all the communities are common across subjects). Sparsify the networks.
1) Threshold (input will be A): For each subject, you can take all the edge values, order them and keep only the top 20% (make it higher to ensure that the resulting network is still connected, no isolate nodes), you need to make
sure that you take the same percentage of edges across all subjects. 
- use the threshold A, \hat{A} and rerun EigenGap to check how K changes
- get the visualization code from Meiby
Feb 10th: use K=6, focus on visualizing the clusters for each layer. Next, transfer the maps to topomaps. (share topomap code)
Feb 17th: Apply to CRN networks for comparison
