January 20th: Discuss the multiplex community detection article, introduce the network datasets and go over the code
January 27th (need to change meeting time): initially run the algorithm with different K rather than learning it from data, go over the initial run of the algorithm on 20 ERN networks and discuss potential problems
Feb 3rd (need to change meeting time): choose K using the algorithm, characterize the common networks

Feb 17th: Apply to CRN networks for comparison
Feb 24th (need to meet earlier)
March 3rd (cancel)
