Joint work with Brooke Spring 2023
January 20th: Discuss the multiplex community detection article, introduce the network datasets and go over the code
Run findingk.m with the data (cell array) and find k, kc, kpr. If k<3 for any of the layers, discard the results. Similarly, if k> 20 for any of the layers, discard 
the results. If this is the case, fix k=6 for each layer, kc=3, kpl=3. Run MX-ONMTF with modularity density for real networks.
January 27th (need to change meeting time): initially run the algorithm with different K rather than learning it from data, go over the initial run of the algorithm on 20 ERN networks and discuss potential problems
Feb 3rd (need to change meeting time): choose K using the algorithm, characterize the common networks

Feb 17th: Apply to CRN networks for comparison
